# Applitools Configuration Presets

I wanted to showcase a few useful configuration options for running Applitools tests. 

### ***Use at your own risk, and understand what each of the settings are indented for before including into your project.*** ### 
</br>
1. Pass Rate Config </br> </br>
Dealing with flaky tests? Not handling viewport-reponsive javascript? Use this! 
</br> </br>
2. Safe Mode Config </br> </br>
Are your test breaking, and you're trying to isolate the problem? Check out safe mode config. Will output the Applitools verbose logs, often containing more details on an error. 
Also has an option to disable Applitools tests to isolate if the error comes from Applitools or elsewhere. 
</br> </br>
3. Performance Config </br> </br>
This is more or less the default configuration. Optimized for performance and to work generally for all pages.
